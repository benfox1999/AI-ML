# PineScript-to-Python for Financial Machine Learning

This repository houses a collection of Python code examples demonstrating the conversion of Pine Script trading strategies and indicators into a format suitable for machine learning applications in finance.

## Motivation

Pine Script is a popular domain-specific language for technical analysis on the TradingView platform. However, leveraging its insights for machine learning often necessitates a translation to a more general-purpose language like Python. This project aims to bridge that gap. 

## Contents

* `conversions/`:  
    * This directory contains Python scripts showcasing the conversion of specific Pine Script strategies or indicators. Each file will be well-documented to explain the original Pine Script logic and its Python equivalent.

* `data/`:
    * (Optional) Sample financial datasets used for demonstration or testing purposes.

* `models/`:
    * (Optional) Trained machine learning models resulting from experiments with the converted strategies.

* `notebooks/`:
    * (Optional) Jupyter notebooks providing exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation related to the converted strategies.

* `README.md`:
    * This file!
