# PineScript-to-Python for Financial Machine Learning

This repository houses a collection of Python code examples demonstrating the conversion of Pine Script trading strategies and indicators into a format suitable for machine learning applications in finance.

## Motivation

Pine Script is a popular domain-specific language for technical analysis on the TradingView platform. However, leveraging its insights for machine learning often necessitates a translation to a more general-purpose language like Python. This project aims to bridge that gap. 

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:** 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/benfox1999/AI-ML
